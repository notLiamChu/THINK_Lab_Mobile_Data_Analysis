# THINK_Lab_Mobile_Data_Analysis
We employ Gaussian Processes (GPs) for mobile data analysis in experiments conducted by Liam Chu and Ekin Ugurel under The University of Washington (UW) THINK Lab.

GP_Kernel_Experiments was updated after completing AMATH 482/582 and using concepts from that class to improve the clarity of my results.

Included 7 page report (+1 for references) generated during AMATH 482/582 with a more formal write up.

Things to improve:
- Use Transformer, RNN, and/or LSTM as SOTA sequence based comparisons instead of random forest.
